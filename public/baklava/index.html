    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 package (16 oz) of phyllo dough</li>
        <li>2 cups of mixed nuts (such as walnuts, pistachios, and almonds), finely chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1/2 cup honey</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Instructions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
        <li>Prepare the syrup by combining sugar, water, honey, and lemon juice in a saucepan. Bring it to a boil, then simmer for about 10 minutes until it thickens slightly. Remove from heat and let it cool.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the finely chopped mixed nuts and ground cinnamon.</li>
        <li>Unroll the phyllo dough and cut it to fit your baking dish. Cover it with a damp cloth to prevent it from drying out.</li>
        <li>Brush a 9x13 inch baking dish with melted butter. Place one sheet of phyllo dough in the dish and brush it with more melted butter. Repeat this process, layering and buttering each sheet until you have about 6 sheets layered.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle a portion of the nut mixture over the phyllo layers.</li>
        <li>Add more phyllo sheets on top of the nut mixture, continuing to butter each sheet.</li>
        <li>Repeat the process, alternating between layers of phyllo sheets and the nut mixture, until all nuts are used.</li>
        <li>Finish with a final layer of phyllo sheets, buttering each one.</li>
        <li>Cut the baklava into diamond or square shapes using a sharp knife. Make sure to cut all the way through the layers.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 50-60 minutes or until the baklava is golden brown and crisp.</li>
        <li>Remove the baklava from the oven and immediately pour the cooled syrup all over it, ensuring it gets evenly distributed into the cuts.</li>
        <li>Allow the baklava to cool completely before serving. It's best when it has had some time to absorb the syrup, typically a few hours or overnight.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your delicious Turkish Baklava!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Note: Baklava is quite sweet, so small portions are usually sufficient. Store any leftovers in an airtight container.</p>
